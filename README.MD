# Itty Bitty Airfreight Cargo Management

## Project Description
This project, titled "Itty Bitty Airfreight (IBA)", is designed to manage cargo loading operations for Boeing 737 and Boeing 767 aircraft. It includes an implementation of an abstract base class 'Cargo', from which two derived classes, 'Boeing737' and 'Boeing767', inherit. Each class represents specific characteristics and load capacities of the respective aircraft types. The program allows for reading cargo data from a file and processing it according to aircraft-specific constraints such as maximum load, ensuring appropriate distribution and weight management.

## Features
- Read cargo data from a file.
- Process cargo data based on aircraft type (Boeing 737 or Boeing 767).
- Check for maximum load constraints.
- Display processed cargo information.
